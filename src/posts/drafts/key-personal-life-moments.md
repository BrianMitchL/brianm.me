Looking back at my life so far, I've realized there are specific moments in my life that I still think back to as being significant in some aspect of my sense of self. These are moments that take some time (years even) to really solidify themselves.

There isn't much in the last couple of years, but I hope to add to this over time. Here's a chronological list of some of these moments.

1. Spring of 7th grade for making music in GarageBand. I went all in on making music with GarageBand 2 on my best friend's iMac G3. It was all arranging the built-in Apple loops, but I made so much content during that period of time. Every couple of years I listen to some songs from that time and get nostalgic and think of what could have been had I really continued making music (this is starting a theme centered around music).

2. Junior High in general for really getting into Apple. I spent so much time reading every page on the [apple.com](https://apple.com) website and Wikipedia pages for every Mac and Apple product. I would fan out from there and learned about operating systems, lower level software principles, and hardware design. I spent 2.5 years saving for a Mac (I finally bought it fall of my freshman year of high school), and wanted to learn all I could about them. If you knew me then, I'm sorry, I'm sure it was all I talked about.

3. Winter 2013, when the Harlem Shake meme was popular, for discovering trap music. I loved this meme for two reasons, the premise was ridiculous (someone dances, then a jump cut to mayhem), and that song was nothing like anything I'd heard before. I looked up the song, found it was made by Baauer, and found similar artists, and songs in the genre from there. I bought the All Trap Music compilation album on iTunes and went from there. A lot of the music I listen to today, has directly branched off of the Harlem Shake, the meme that changed my life (for music).

4. August 28th, 2015 for finding a whole new group and era of music. I was maybe two weeks into living in Copenhagen, Denmark for the semester, and came home after going out drinking. I wasn't ready to sleep yet, so I decided to look up some songs I had saved from Shazam from earlier in the night. This lead me to add 100 songs from Danish rappers. I still listen to and have branched out from this initial set to this day. When listening to some of these songs, I'm sent right back to where I was at that time: newly in Denmark, sitting at my desk with headphones on, with the sun rising out my window (I think I stayed up until around 06:00 that night).

5. April 10th â€” 23rd, 2016 for lighting design at the University of Minnesota, Morris. This time period was just weeks before I would graduate, after I had worked for the Student Center Tech Crew doing mostly lighting work for 3.5 years. By this time, I knew our equipment in-and-out, and was pushing the limits on what we could do in the space. This was a two-week period where I worked on two different dance productions, back-to-back. The first was a longer piece for a friend who choreographed a senior project. The second was the Dance Ensemble production for the semester, where there were 23 different pieces making up the show. After working with the plot I designed for a week on the first production, I was able to work even faster for the fast pace that goes into a Dance Ensemble production. This was my third time as lighting designer for Dance Ensemble, so I had worked with many of the choreographers and knew what to expect. I think this period of time was perhaps my favorite for all of my time at UMM. This was the final cultivation of years in elementary school, junior high school, high school, and college with working on technical theater and event production. I returned my tech crew keys a few weeks after this and I was hit with a wall of emotions and took a very long sad walk home.
