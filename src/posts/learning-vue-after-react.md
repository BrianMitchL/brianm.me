In early June, I started working at [soona](https://soona.co), a media production company with a virtual content studio.
I joined as they were ramping up an effort to migrate from Vue 2.6 to Vue 3.
I'll discuss my background in learning new frontend libraries and how I went about it with Vue.

## The Early Days

Back when I was an intern in 2015, I worked with another intern and wrote our project using jQuery, and a few jQuery UI plug-ins.
I had done some AngularJS at this point, but not for this internship {% emoji "ðŸ˜…", "grinning face with sweat" %}.
When I started working full-time after college in 2016, I dove in deep with AngularJS.
I developed a better sense of component design and architectural patterns for a frontend application.
By late 2017, it seemed like most frontend devs I knew were using another library, often React.

## Learning React

I managed to start learning React back in late 2017 for a lower priority admin app.
A coworker lent me a 200-page book about React that I read in a day, and then dove in.
I watched a few EggHead tutorials about React and Redux.
I was so excited to have the opportunity to use a modern framework at work and learn something new!

## Hello Vue
