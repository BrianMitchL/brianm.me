## Text

### Body Text

<div style="font-family: var(--font-body)">

Text is important, there are lots of things you can do with it!

This paragraph is for testing font features. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. 0987654321. tt TT Qq. Artificial, practical. Those words were for testing the ligatures from a 't' or an 'f' to an 'i'. _italic_ **bold** _**italic bold**_

### Markdown

A paragraph of text with a [link](https://brianm.me)! Here's an emoji {% emoji "üëç", "thumbs up" %}. We can have _italicized text_, **bold text**, <q>quoted text</q>, and ~~striked text~~. **A mix of bold and _italicized text_**

> A blockquote, how cool is this!?

How about some inline `code` or keyboard sequences, <kbd>Command + Tab</kbd>?

We can also be super fancy and add footnotes[^short] to our text to reference things[^long]. You can also make them inline^[This footnote is defined right next to the text that it's noting.].

[^short]: Here is the footnote.
[^long]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Indented paragraphs belong to the previous footnote. Find the docs on the [markdown-it-footnote](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it-footnote) docs.

### HTML

Here are some HTML elements to format text outside of markdown. I could configure it, but I don't really use these much, so inlining HTML on a static site seems fine if I do.

<samp>Computer output example with a &lt;samp&gt; element.</samp>

What if we want to <mark>highlight</mark> some text?

What do <ins>inserts</ins> look like?

Here is a <sub>subscript</sub> and a <sup>superscript</sup>!
