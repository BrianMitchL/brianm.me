First and foremost, I have upgraded the "fork me on Github" banner! I'm using the orange one from [aral's Github Retina ribbons](https://github.com/aral/fork-me-on-github-retina-ribbons "aral's Github retina ribbons")

I've decided to use an orange and blue theme for the site. As a fan of the color orange, and the fact that orange and blue are complimentary colors, I think it'll fit well. Let's hope that I can make a nice looking theme with my mediocre CSS skills.

Do you like rounded rectangles? Because I do, and I hope that'll work out.
