I feel that there's not a lot that I can do to add more pop to this website without cluttering it or losing the simplicity. A lot of this site is made and styled using bootstrap, so some things are more annoying to fix and hard to figure out how they work, such as the nav bar and the collapse feature on mobile. Currently it switches to collapse mode somewhere in between the width of an iPad and an iPhone, so I'm not too concerned, but it's on my mind to fix at some point.

If you have any comments or suggestions about the design of the site, please discuss it in the comments (because so many people come to this page :P)
