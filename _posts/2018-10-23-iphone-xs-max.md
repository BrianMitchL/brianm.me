The iPhone X<span class="small-caps">S</span> Max is a moderate "S" year
upgrade over the iPhone X, with the addition of a larger 6.5" display, improved
camera, faster processor, and additional memory.

Checkout my [iPhone 7 Review]({{site.baseurl}}/posts/iphone-7) to get an
understanding of where I'm coming from.

## Pre-Delivery Anticipations

Maybe I'm getting older, maybe I'm not as "into Apple" as I once was, or maybe
the iPhones these days just have a much longer life, but I felt like this time
I had the fewest reasons to upgrade after two years as I had in the past. iOS
12 runs very well on my iPhone 7, and it did everything it needed to for me.
That being said, there are new features on the iPhone
X<span class="small-caps">S</span> (and me keeping an every-other-year upgrade
cycle) that still made me decide to upgrade to the iPhone
X<span class="small-caps">S</span> Max.

Now that I live within a ten minute walk to an Apple Store, I decided to pick
the phone up in store. This was a great decision, I was in and out in 15
minutes!

### The Size

Because I came from the iPhone 7 (and before that, the iPhone 6), I've been
using the 4.7" size for four years. The Plus sized iPhones always seemed way too
large, but something about this even _larger_ screen seemed enticing.

Like the 4.7" displays over the earlier 4" and even 3.5" displays, it's impossible
to reach the entire display. I find myself gripping the iPhone
X<span class="small-caps">S</span> Max with two hands much more frequently than
earlier iPhones. Part of this is for stability to make sure I don't drop the phone,
but it's also so I can interact with everything that's on the screen. This is a
worthy trade off because I can see so much more on the screen, media is larger,
and I can use the two-column layouts that are unique to iPads and iPhone Pluses
(iPhones Plus?).

### Speed

The A12 Bionic SoC packs a 64-bit, 7 nm processor (the definition of a 7nm
processor can vary widely, so take it with a grain of salt) with six cores: two
performance cores and four high-efficiency cores. It also includes a new
"8-core Neural Engine." Apple didn't market the chip as being all that much faster,
especially with the A11 and A12 both sharing the "Bionic" name, but this chip
is _fast_. [Some reports](https://www.anandtech.com/show/13392/the-iphone-xs-xs-max-review-unveiling-the-silicon-secrets)
go as far as saying the A12 Bionic is 40% faster than the A11 Bionic.

Here's a breakdown of Geekbench 4 results from the more recent iPhones and
my current devices. I'm particularly impressed with how well the A12 Bionic
compares to my aging mid-2012 MacBook Pro and it's multi-core performance in
general.

The A12 Bionic is the first processor to support the ARMv8.3 instruction set
which adds a new float-to-int instruction that handles
number exceptions the same way that JavaScript does. This makes the
iPhone X<span class="small-caps">S</span> one of the fastest devices to run
JavaScript.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" data-lang="en">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">More precisely: ARMv8.3 adds a new float-to-int
  instruction with errors and out-of-range values handled the way that
  JavaScript wants. The previous insns to get JavaScript&#39;s semantics
  were much slower. JavaScript&#39;s numbers are double by default so it needs
  this conversion a lot.</p>&mdash; Greg Parker (@gparker)

### Display

The iPhone X<span class="small-caps">S</span> Max packs a 6.5" OLED display at
a resolution of 2688x1242 (458 ppi). Now because it is OLED display, the pixel
density is really only true for the green sub-pixels.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" data-lang="en">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">So what does PenTile mean in practice on iPhone
  X? Only green is &#39;true 3X&#39; You need exceedingly tiny text
  to notice the effect, just about the limits of decent human vision.

OLED displays have a ridiculous contrast ratio because each pixel provides its
own light. This means that if black is being displayed on the display, the pixels
aren't even lit. A trade-off of this is that if you are switching from black
to any other color, there is a small delay because the pixel needs to turn itself
on. It is apparent when scrolling a list of items with a pure black theme.
The edge content of an animating object seems to lag behind the rest.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" data-lang="en">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">What does OLED black smearing look like?
  In this example, the dark grey square seems to be lagging behind the
  light grey square, but they’re locked together. (Needs to be viewed
  on an OLED screen.) <a href="https://t.co/WYFEXKAvsG">pic.twitter.com/WYFEXKAvsG</a>

Trade-offs aside, I love this display. The OLED display makes it a joy to use at
night when dark themes in apps kick in.

### Camera

The camera on the iPhone X<span class="small-caps">S</span> is the real
flagship feature. It has a dual camera system, like the Plus sized iPhones
from the past four years: a wide-angle ƒ/1.8 and a telephoto ƒ/2.4. New with
the iPhone X<span class="small-caps">S</span> is that the wide-angle lens
now has a 26mm equivalent focal length (compared to 28mm on the iPhone X),
which means you can fit a bit more from a scene into the frame.

The sensors in the new iPhone also are about [30% larger](https://daringfireball.net/2018/09/the_iphones_xs),
which reduces noise and increases brightness in dark areas. Both the wide-angle
and telephoto sensors have a wider ISO range, which further helps to reduce
grain. Photos can now be exposed at up to one second (1/3 second in earlier
iPhones).

I'd highly recommend looking at the
[Halide](http://halide.cam/) team's [hardware breakdown](https://blog.halide.cam/iphone-xs-vs-iphone-x-the-camera-hardware-changes-496b40ceae3a)
and more software focused [iPhone XS: Why It's A Whole New Camera](https://blog.halide.cam/iphone-xs-why-its-a-whole-new-camera-ddf9780d714c).
Both posts go into great detail about the improvements in the iPhone
X<span class="small-caps">S</span>'s camera(s); it's truly impressive.

#### Photo

Apple introduced Portrait mode with the iPhone X last year, but this is
a first for me. It works the same way as the X, but you can now adjust the
bokeh effect during or after taking the photo. From the few portrait photos
I've taken, I'm quite impressed.

What excites me most about the new cameras are the improved sensors combined
with the new Smart HDR. Apple introduced HDR with the iPhone 4 back in 2010;
It took a photo at normal, above, and below exposure. I think it has continued
to work in mostly the same way until now. Smart HDR takes several more photos at different
exposures, and uses the A12 Bionic's Neural Engine to stitch the final photo back together,
combining the different exposures. This makes for incredible detail, almost in
an unatural way (at least when comparing to traditional cameras), where areas
that would normally be over or under exposed are now included at an exposure
that matches that area's brightness into the final image.

#### Video

The camera on the iPhone X<span class="small-caps">S</span> will step down
the frame rate of a 30fps video to 24fps if there isn't enough brightness in
the scene. This will increase the brightness and detail in video recorded in
low-light scenes.

New with this iPhone, video is recorded with stereo microphones! :tada:

New last year with the iPhone 8 and X (but new to me), video can be recorded at
at 60 fps when using the HEVC codec. Good thing I got the 256 GB iPhone, because
video at that quality uses a ton of disk space.

  <figcaption>Video example. This looks even better in 4K at 60fps with the raw 217.2 MB HEVC file.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Other

The iPhone X<span class="small-caps">S</span> is now rated for IP68 water
resistance (maximum depth of 2 meters up to 30 minutes). This is a nice improvement
on something I hope to never have to test. Though, I did once bike with my iPhone 7
in my bike mount while it was raining, because I knew it should be fine (it was).

The battery life in this iPhone is incredible! I really wasn't expecting such an
improvement. One day I left work and my phone still had 86% battery left! I
didn't charge it that night, and finally plugged it in right before bed the day
after, at 1% left. I don't think I've ever gotten two full days out of a single
charge on any of my iPhones in the past.

The physical form of the iPhone X<span class="small-caps">S</span> Max is nearly
the same as the iPhone 8 Plus, but with a stainless steel band around the sides
and an awesome edge-to-edge OLED display.

I picked up a Qi charger with my iPhone and use it to charge every night. It's a
small thing, but it's nice to just rest the iPhone on my bedside table and it just
starts charging. Sometimes it takes a little nudge to get lined up, but it emits a
sound when it starts charging, so it doesn't bother me at all.

FaceID is great most of the time. I'm used to it now, but every so often I do wish
I could unlock my phone without needing to point the phone towards my face. However,
once the phone is unlocked I love how easy FaceID is. If I'm already using the phone, it
authenticates me without requiring me to do anything. My favorite use of this is with
the 1Password extension for entering passwords on websites and apps. All I need to do
is tap the suggestion in the QuickType area above the keyboard and it automatically
verifies my face and enters the username and password. I hope FaceID gets faster over
time, I feel like I always have to wait for the animation to finish when authenticating
myself in apps.

The iPhone X<span class="small-caps">S</span> now also has 4 GB of RAM, which will
allow for better multi-tasking and more advanced applications that consume lots of
memory.

## Conclusion

In short, :thumbsup: :thumbsup:!

I'm happy with my decision to try the larger sized model of iPhone. I have to be
more careful when holding it to minimize the risk of dropping it due to the
larger size and weight, but it's important to protect your phone either way, right?
While I never really thought my iPhone 7 was very slow, the six-core A12 Bionic is
certainly much faster. I look forward to continue to take even better photos with
the much improved camera(s).
