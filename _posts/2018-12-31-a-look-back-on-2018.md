I saw several people reflecting on personal accomplishments from the previous year,
so I thought I would jump on the bandwagon and do so as well ðŸ™‚.

Here are ten notable things that I did in 2018:

1.  In January, I moved a few miles north to an apartment in Uptown, Minneapolis.
    I love being just a short walk from a multitude of shops, restaurants, and things to do.
    Being close to the Midtown Greenway and the chain of lakes makes for great biking
    and connections to other places in Minneapolis and Saint Paul.
    As the year went on, I outfitted the apartment with HomeKit LED lights. I have two
    in my bedroom, and a combination of two outlets and an LED strip in my living room.
    It's very colorful and fun. For the ultimate hands-free (lazy?) life, I have them
    set up to automatically turn on or off if I arrive or leave home, respectively :grin:.

2.  I started working with [React](https://reactjs.org) and
    [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) quite extensively at work. My team
    transformed and became focused on a new project so I was able to learn and start
    building the new codebase with modern tools and libraries. I've also spent a lot of
    time helping and mentoring other UI developers learn and troubleshoot similar setups.

3.  In January - March, I was Lighting Designer for Young Artists Initiativeâ€™s production
    of _Annie_. I hadn't worked on a show since graduating from college in 2016, so I was delighted
    to have the opportunity again.

4.  In April, some friends and I traveled to Estonia, Latvia, and Ukraine. The cities I
    visited were beautiful, and seeing the city of Pripyat, the Chernobyl Nuclear Power
    Plant, and Duga Radar was an incredible, heartbreaking, and one of the most unique experiences
    I have ever had.

5.  In early June, I rode in the MS150 for the second time. I spent the month or two
    before getting comfortable on my bike and training for the ride, even biking 16 miles (ca. 26 km)
    to and from work a couple of times. This year's ride was better in every way!

6.  In November, I bought a MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2018, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports), which I
    named [Skylab]({% link uses.md %}#home-office). It replaced my
    aging MacBook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012). This came two months after my Hackintosh
    [bit the bullet]({% link _posts/2018-09-23-a-hackintosh-reflection.md %}). I have a nice
    laptop stand and giving the whole laptop-at-a-desk thing a try for the first time since early
    on in college. So far so good, but I very well may be buying an iMac next year...

    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My MacBook Pro has ascended (with a <a href="https://twitter.com/macallyusa?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@macallyusa</a> stand). <a href="https://t.co/w0YKS1wfPc">pic.twitter.com/w0YKS1wfPc</a></p>&mdash; Brian Mitchell (@BrianMitchL) <a href="https://twitter.com/BrianMitchL/status/1067574204592050177?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2018</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

7.  I actually wrote new content for this website! I posted about
    [Charlie the Hubot]({% link _posts/2018-07-29-charlie-the-hubot.md %}) I help
    with at work, [A Hackintosh Reflection]({% link _posts/2018-09-23-a-hackintosh-reflection.md %}),
    an [iPhone X<span class="small-caps">S</span> Max]({% link _posts/2018-10-23-iphone-xs-max.md %})
    review, and two living documents, the [gear]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/living-docs/gear)
    and the [software]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/living-docs/software) I use. Update (March 2020): I've now moved these to a single [Uses]({% link uses.md %}) page.

8.  Podcasts: I continued to host [PodKit](http://thenexus.tv/category/pk/) and was in several
    episodes of [The Extra Dimension](http://thenexus.tv/category/ted/),
    [Second Opinion](http://thenexus.tv/category/so/), and
    [Nexus Special](http://thenexus.tv/category/ns/). I spent some time
    improving my Logic Pro X podcasting template to add compressors, limiters, de-essers, and
    better equalizing. I hope to keep PodKit on a better schedule. We're notoriously bad at
    any sort of consistency.

9.  I read books this year! I listened to _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_ by Douglas
    Adams and _Artemis_ by Andy Weir. I'm also part way through _Typeset in the Future: Typography
    and Design in Science Fiction Movies_ by Dave Addey. I recommend all of them!

10. Finally, I went to more concerts/shows this year than any year before. I went to nearly
    all EDM shows of some sort at The Loft, Skyway Theater Main Stage, and First Ave. Don't worry,
    I happily wear my ear plugs to every show and am glad that the city of Minneapolis requires concert
    venues to provide them for free in case I forget them. My favorite show was definitely CloZee at
    The Loft at the end of September. Her music is a unique and wonderful blend of electronic and
    bass music, with undertones and influences from all over the world.

2018 was a great year and I am looking forward to seeing what next year brings! Happy New Year! :tada:

Here's a bonus 11th item:
I bought the LEGO NASA Apollo Saturn V. Look at it. It's great. I want more. :smiling_imp:
