The iPhone X<span class="small-caps">S</span> Max is a moderate "S" year
upgrade over the iPhone X, with the addition of a larger 6.5" display, improved
camera, faster processor, and additional memory.

Checkout my [iPhone 7 Review]({{site.baseurl}}/posts/iphone-7) to get an
understanding of where I'm coming from.

## Pre-Delivery Anticipations

Maybe I'm getting older, maybe I'm not as "into Apple" as I once was, or maybe
the iPhones these days just have a much longer life, but I felt like this time
I had the fewest reasons to upgrade after two years as I had in the past. iOS
12 runs very well on my iPhone 7, and it did everything it needed to for me.
That being said, there are new features on the iPhone
X<span class="small-caps">S</span> (and me keeping an every-other-year upgrade
cycle) that still made me decide to upgrade to the iPhone XS Max.

Now that I live within a ten minute walk on an Apple Store, I decided to pick
the phone up in store. This was a great decision, I was in and out in 15
minutes!

### The Size

Because I came from the iPhone 7 (and before that, the iPhone 6), I've been
using the 4.7" size for years. The Plus sized iPhones always seemed way too
large, but something about this even _larger_ screen seemed enticing.

### Speed

The A12 Bionic SoC packs a 64-bit, 7 nm processor with six cores: two
performance cores and four high-efficiency cores. It also includes a new
"8-core Neural Engine."

[Some reports](https://www.anandtech.com/show/13392/the-iphone-xs-xs-max-review-unveiling-the-silicon-secrets)
go as far as saying the A12 Bionic CPU is 40% faster than the A11 Bionic.


The ARMv8.3 instruction set adds a new float-to-int instruction that handles
errors and out-of-range exceptions the same way that JavaScript does.

  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">More precisely: ARMv8.3 adds a new float-to-int
  instruction with errors and out-of-range values handled the way that
  JavaScript wants. The previous insns to get JavaScript&#39;s semantics
  were much slower. JavaScript&#39;s numbers are double by default so it needs
  this conversion a lot.</p>&mdash; Greg Parker (@gparker)
