Now that I added share buttons to posts, I think that this website/blog is pretty much complete! I seemed to hammer out all of the bugs that I had with comments and styling of the share buttons (aside from the horizontal whitespace...). Hopefully I'll start using this site for things other than updates on the development of it.
