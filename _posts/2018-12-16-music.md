To most people, I probably wouldn't describe my tastes in music as "normal." A quick description I tell people is that if it has a guitar in it, I probably don't listen to it. I find a statement like that is easier to say than getting into the intricacies of my tastes in Electronic, Trap, and Hip-Hop/Rap music. This post will attempt to get into those details and give me a good place to reflect on the music I listen to.

## Origins

Way back when I was a kid, I remember listening to some tapes with my dad. He played an album of a band that used focused more on the drums than I had heard before. Seemingly, from that point on, I'd always focused on the drums or beat of a song. I think a lot of that is due to the fact that I liked Hip-Hop beats, but wasn't really exposed to them in a great amount until fourth grade (2003-2004).

In fourth grade, a couple of days a week, I went to another elementary school after school until my parents came and picked me up. The bus driver on this other route would play the local Hip-Hop and Pop station. Oh man was I exposed to a lot of music that year. Some notable songs I first heard then are from a few from Sean Paul's album "Dutty Rock", "In da Club" by 50 Cent, "Hey Ya!" by Outkast, and the infamous "Yeah!" by Usher.

In junior high, I listened to a lot of Weird Al and small independent musicians from the Newgrounds Audio Portal. In high school (2008-2012), I started exploring more and listened to a lot of electronic music artists like Bassnectar, Pendulum, Pretty Lights, Basshunter, Skrillex, Klaypex, as well as hip-hop/rap like Eminem and The Lonely Island.

I can list artists I listen to, but that doesn't tell the whole story at all.

## Lyrics

A lot of the music I listen to is light on lyrics, if it has any at all. Even with lyrics, I don't actively listen to the words. There are songs I've listened to hundreds of times that I couldn't sing along to. That being said, I do really value lyrics in songs. They add an irreplaceable "voice" (ha!) and natural sound to a song. The rhythm, melody, and tone of a voice is more important to me than the language thay the singer/lyricist is conveying.

I listen to many Danish (as well as other languages such as a little French, Swedish, and Norwegian) artists. Unless I'm trying really hard (and even then my Danish isn't even close to being good enough), I don't usually have more than a general idea about what the rapper (most of the Danish music I listen to is rap) is talking about. If I'm really liking a song, I'll look up and read the lyrics, and often run them through Google Translate as well.

## Genres

## Remixes

If you're on the fence or don't think remixes are important, I highly recommend you watch Kirby Ferguson's fantastic series, [Everything is a Remix](https://vimeo.com/139094998). I also suggest you look up some of your favorite songs on [https://www.whosampled.com](https://www.whosampled.com), which shows songs that sample from other songs.

As I'm writing this I have 16,816 songs in my iTunes library (a mix of real files and Apple Music) and of that, 1,278 (7.6%) of them are remixes.
