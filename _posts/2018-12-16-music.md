To most people, I probably wouldn't describe my tastes in music as "normal." A general guideline I tell people is that if it has a guitar in it, I probably don't listen to it. I find a statement like that is easier to say than getting into electronic, hip-hop, and trap music genres and sub-genres.

A lot of the music I listen to is light on lyrics, if it has any at all. Even with lyrics, I don't actively listen to the words. There are songs I've listened to hundreds of times that I couldn't sing along to.

Way back when I was a kid, I remember listening to some tapes with my dad. He played an album of a band that used focused more on the drums than I had heard before. I've always focused on the drums or beat of a song.

In junior high, I listened to a lot of Weird Al and small independent musicians from the Newgrounds Audio Portal. In high school (2008-2012), I started exploring more and listened to a lot of electronic music artists like Bassnectar, Pendulum, Pretty Lights, Basshunter, Skrillex, Klaypex, as well as hip-hop/rap like Eminem and The Lonely Island.

I can list artists I listen to, but that doesn't tell the whole story at all.
