<p>
    I am a computer science major at The University of Minnesota, Morris.<br />
    Raised in Saint Paul, MN.<br />
    I am interested in web development and have worked with AngularJS. I also have experience with Java and Python development. I am fairly proficient in a Terminal and enjoy tinkering and configuring things. Hopefully I'll get into iOS and/or OS X development someday.<br />
